## Indexes

Performance indexes are created on:

- Foreign keys
- Frequently queried columns (username, location, etc.)

- Applied to all main tables

## Seed Data

## Future Migrations

Create new migration files with incrementing numbers:

- `002_add_achievements.sql`
- `003_add_events.sql`
- etc.

## Testing

Use the `todos` table for testing Supabase connectivity:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('todos')
  .select('*');
```

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check Supabase documentation: [supabase.com/docs](https://supabase.com/docs)
2. Review migration logs: `supabase db diff`
3. Check RLS policies if data access issues occur

## Backup

Regular backups are recommended:

```bash
# Export current schema
supabase db dump -f backup.sql

# Export data only
supabase db dump --data-only -f data.sql
```
