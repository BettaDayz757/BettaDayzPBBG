#### DNS Configuration
For each domain, ensure these DNS records exist:

**bettadayz.shop:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Target: your-project.pages.dev
Proxy: Yes (Orange cloud)

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Target: your-project.pages.dev
Proxy: Yes (Orange cloud)
```

**bettadayz.store:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Target: your-project.pages.dev
Proxy: Yes (Orange cloud)

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Target: your-project.pages.dev
Proxy: Yes (Orange cloud)
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Failures
**Issue:** Build fails during deployment
**Solutions:**
- Check Node.js version (should be 20+)
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Review build logs for specific errors

#### Domain Access Issues
**Issue:** Domain doesn't load or shows errors
**Solutions:**
- Verify DNS configuration
- Check SSL certificate status
- Confirm custom domain is properly added
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

#### Authentication Problems
**Issue:** Login/signup doesn't work
**Solutions:**
- Verify Supabase configuration
- Check CORS settings in Supabase
- Confirm redirect URLs include both domains
- Test with incognito/private browsing

#### CORS Errors
**Issue:** API calls fail with CORS errors
**Solutions:**
- Add both domains to Supabase CORS settings
- Check middleware configuration
- Verify environment variables
- Test API endpoints individually

#### Performance Issues
**Issue:** Slow loading times
**Solutions:**
- Check Cloudflare caching settings
- Optimize images and assets
- Review bundle size
- Enable compression

## Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] Both domains are accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] All functionality works on both domains
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Performance meets targets (< 3s initial load)
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics are working

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous Git commit
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Cloudflare Rollback:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages deployment history
   - Click on previous successful deployment
   - Click "Retry deployment"

3. **DNS Rollback:**
   - Temporarily point domains to maintenance page
   - Update DNS records to previous configuration

## Post-Deployment Tasks

After successful deployment:
- [ ] Update documentation with new domain information
- [ ] Notify team members of successful deployment
- [ ] Schedule regular monitoring checks
- [ ] Plan next iteration/improvements
- [ ] Update any external services with new domain URLs
- [ ] Create backup of working configuration
