Getting started with the 3D demo (vehicle driving & character customization)
=================================================

This repository has small demo components to help you prototype a GTA-like world in the browser using WebGL and physics.

Files added:
- `app/components/VehicleSimulation.jsx` — A minimal physics-enabled chassis demo (keyboard W/A/S/D). Replace with a glTF car model and expand physics using `@react-three/cannon`'s raycast vehicle helpers.
- `app/components/CharacterCustomization3D.jsx` — A demo showing how to load a glTF character and swap clothing materials/colors.

Install the newly added dependencies (we added them to `package.json`):

```bash
npm install
```

Running locally (development):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes and recommended improvements for production-level realism
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Use high-quality PBR assets (glTF/GLB) exported from Blender, Maya, or other DCC tools. Required maps: baseColor (albedo), normal, roughness, metalness, and ambient occlusion.
- For realistic characters, use a scanned/photogrammetry workflow or high-quality character packs. Respect licenses.
- Use GPU-accelerated physics if needed. `cannon-es` is fine for prototyping; consider Rapier/PhysX for more advanced vehicle dynamics.
- Vehicles: implement `raycastVehicle` from `@react-three/cannon` for realistic wheel suspension and steering. Add skid, tire friction, collisions, and sounds.
- LOD and texture streaming: use lower LODs for far away vehicles and characters. Stream high-res textures when close.
- Animation: use retargeted skeleton animations and GPU skinning. Blend multiple animations (idle, walk, run, drive) and use additive/masked animations for upper body.
- Shaders: use normal-based clearcoat, subsurface scattering (SSS) for skin, and PBR-based reflections for clothing/metal.

Assets and licensing
--------------------

I did not add any game assets (models/textures) to the repo. To remain compliant with copyright, acquire or create your own assets, or use appropriately licensed assets.

GitHub Pages
------------

- For a static site, build output should be placed into a `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages. Remix apps are not trivially static; consider building a static export or hosting on a proper server (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel) if your game requires server-side features.

Next steps (recommended)
------------------------

1. Import or create GLB car and character models. Place them under `public/models/` and update the demo component URLs.
2. Replace the placeholder physics logic in `VehicleSimulation.jsx` with a full `useRaycastVehicle` implementation.
3. Add UI to spawn vehicles, enter/exit vehicles, camera systems (third/first-person) and driving HUD (speedometer, tachometer).
4. Add optimized textures and streaming strategy for performance.

If you want, I can implement a full raycast vehicle example and wire enter/exit vehicle mechanics next — tell me which model URLs you want to use (or I'll add placeholders and instructions to swap in your assets).
