# BettaDayz PBBG - Norfolk Business Empire

## DNSSEC: bettadayz.shop

To enable DNSSEC you will need to add the following DS record at your registrar for bettadayz.shop. Most registrars ask for only a subset of these fields.

- DS Record: bettadayz.shop. 3600 IN DS 2371 13 2 195306F5DBE79C69C5DAD1D6F6E28394C584E03FEB0ADE7AE52EBD452D653F77
- Digest: 195306F5DBE79C69C5DAD1D6F6E28394C584E03FEB0ADE7AE52EBD452D653F77
- Digest Type: 2 (SHA256)
- Algorithm: 13
- Public Key: mdsswUyr3DPW132mOi8V9xESWE8jTo0dxCjjnopKl+GqJxpVXckHAeF+KkxLbxILfDLUT0rAK9iUzy1L53eKGQ==

Notes:

- Also toggle DNSSEC to On in the Cloudflare zone for bettadayz.shop, then add the DS at the registrar. Propagation can take up to 24 hours.
- Repeat analogous steps for bettadayz.store when its DS values are available from Cloudflare.

## Troubleshooting: 403 Forbidden on Cloudflare Pages

If you see ‚ÄúFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)‚Äù, the server denied access to an existing resource. Common causes include strict host allowlists, missing index files, or WAF rules.

For this project specifically, ensure the Cloudflare Pages middleware allows the Pages alias and preview domains:

- File: `functions/_middleware.js`
- Allow hostnames ending with `.pages.dev` and `localhost` in addition to production domains. We‚Äôve updated this already to fix deploy previews and the main alias.

General checks:

- Verify the URL and that an `index.html` exists for static directories.
- Check server/app logs and any WAF settings.
- Confirm client auth headers/cookies are present for protected routes.
